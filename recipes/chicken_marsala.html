        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian American dish that's creamy, quick, and irresistible.
             The creamy sauce made of mushrooms, marsala wine, and heavy cream is straight-up drinkable, 
             and we love serving it over a big pile of spaghetti or angel hair. The marsala wine makes it
              slightly sweet and is what gives it that addictive quality. It's the perfect weeknight dinner ,
               and we don't even feel guilty making it three nights in a row. It's a real plus that this dish
                comes together in a flash.</p>
